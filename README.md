## Branching Strategy

This document outlines our branching strategy which is designed to ensure a robust and efficient workflow for managing code changes across our project. This strategy supports multiple parallel developments effectively, minimizes conflicts, and maintains a stable mainline.

### Overview

Our strategy involves several types of branches:
- **Main**: Stable production code.
- **Develop**: Integration branch for features.
- **Feature**: Individual feature and improvement work.
- **Release**: Preparing for a production release.
- **Hotfix**: Urgent fixes for production issues.

### Main Branch

**Purpose**:
- Serves as the primary branch where the final, stable source code of the project resides.
- Always deployable and represents the latest production release.

**Management**:
- Direct commits to this branch are prohibited.
- Updates to this branch are made through pull requests from either `develop`, `release`, or `hotfix` branches once the code has been reviewed and tested thoroughly.

### Develop Branch

**Purpose**:
- Acts as the main integration branch for features.
- Serves as a staging area before code is moved to the production environment.

**Management**:
- All feature branches are merged back into `develop` once the feature development is complete.
- Ensure that CI builds pass when integrating new features.
- Once `develop` is stable and ready for release, it is merged into a `release` branch for final testing before merging into `main`.

### Feature Branches

**Naming Convention**:
- Branches should be named descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-login`, `feature/improve-loading-speed`.

**Purpose**:
- Used for developing new features or improvements isolated from the main development activity.
- Helps minimize conflicts when multiple team members work on different aspects of the project.

**Lifecycle**:
- Each feature branch should be derived from `develop`.
- After completion and thorough testing, as well as peer review, the feature branch is merged back into `develop`.

### Release Branches

**Optional**:
- Utilized if the project lifecycle includes distinct release phases or when preparing for a production deployment.

**Management**:
- Branch off from `develop`.
- Name conventionally as `release/{version_number}`.
- After final adjustments and testing, merge into `main` and back into `develop` to capture any last-minute changes made during release preparations.

### Hotfix Branches

**Purpose**:
- To quickly address and resolve critical bugs in the production environment.

**Management**:
- Branch from `main`.
- After the fix, merge it immediately back into both `main` and `develop`.
- Hotfix branches should be named like `hotfix/issue-fixed`.

### Contribution and Workflow
- Always pull the latest changes from the upstream branch before starting work.
- Push your branch and create a pull request for review.
- Ensure that all integrations and tests pass before seeking final approval for merging.
- Delete your branch after it has been merged to keep the repository clean.

### Summary

This branching strategy is designed to maintain high standards of code quality and stability in our production environment. By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure efficient and orderly development processes, supporting team collaboration and project scalability.
